# Logo Interpreter

I was inspired to write a 
[Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) interpreter by 
Dan Shiffman at Coding Train in
[this video](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/121.1-logo-interpreter.html).
I'd been thinking about it for years, but I finally got around to it :-)
